git init -> created a .git folder, and gives power to managed by GIT.

there are three stage area of files in git.
1. working area
2. staging area
3. repository area

different git commands are there :
1.git add filename
2.git commit
3.git status
4.git log
5.git rm --cached filename
6.git restore file.
7.git restore --staged filename :- bring the file from staging area to working area.
This only works if changes done in staging area.
8. git rm --cached filename : -> bring the file in untrack area.

==> difference b/w git rm and git restore :-
rm bring the files in untarck area. 
restore bring the file in working area from staged area or remove 
the content from working area.

9. git commit -m "message of commit" -> used to pass the message without opening the
editor in terminal.
